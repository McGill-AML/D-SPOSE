//% FUNCTION NAME:        aero_torque.c
//%
//% DESCRIPTION:          This function calculates the torque on surface
//%                       due to atmospheric drag for a spinning satellite
//%                       (See Eq. (19) and Appendix B in Sagnieres et al.
//%                       (2018), JGCD)

//% INPUT:                double rho: atmospheric density (kg m-3)
//%                       double Cd: drag coefficient
//%                       double v[3]: relative wind speed body frame (m s-1)
//%                       double w[3]: relative atmosphere angular
//%                         velocity in body frame (m s-1)
//%                       struct surface geometry: surface geometry
//%
//% OUTPUT:               double g[3]: torque on surface due to atmospheric
//%                         drag in body frame
