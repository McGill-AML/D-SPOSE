//% FUNCTION NAME:        srp_force.c
//%
//% DESCRIPTION:          This function calculates the force on a single
//%                       surface due to direct solar radiation

//% INPUT:                struct surface geometry: surface geometry
//%                       double cos_alpha: cosine of angle between light
