//% FUNCTION NAME:        aero_force.c
//%
//% DESCRIPTION:          This function calculates the force on surface
//%                       due to atmospheric drag for a spinning satellite
//%                       (See Eq. (18) and Appendix B in Sagnieres et al.
//%                       (2018), JGCD)

//% INPUT:                double rho: atmospheric density (kg m-3)
//%                       double Cd: drag coefficient
//%                       double v[3]: relative wind speed ECI (m s-1)
//%                       double w_rel_i[3]: relative atmosphere angular
//%                         velocity inertial frame (m s-1)
//%                       struct surface geometry: surface geometry
//%                       double C_b2i[3][3]: rotation matrix from body
//%                         frame to inertial frame
//%
//% OUTPUT:               double f[3]: force on surface due to atmospheric
//%                         drag in inertial frame
