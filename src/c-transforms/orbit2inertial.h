//% FUNCTION NAME:        orbit2inertial.c
//%
//% DESCRIPTION:          This function converts a position and velocity
//%                       vector to a rotation matrix rotating from the
//%                       orbital frame to the inertial frame
//%

//% INPUT:                double p[3]: 3x1 position vector (m)
//%                       double v[3]: 3x1 velocity vector (m s-1)
//%
//% OUTPUT:               double C_o2i[3][3]: rotation matrix from orbital
//%                         frame to inertial frame
